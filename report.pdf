Report for this assignmnt:

PC1 and PC2 are contributing more than 30% of variance of dataset. This can be seen by how eigenvalue spread from large to small;
so if we ignore the very very smallest one in svd ; their is no significant effect on data of genes. Basically we exclude redundunt data
from sample.

Remaining 22409 dimension are contributing remaining 60% of variance of dataset; although remaining contribution is 60% majority of this 
is from pc3 and pc4.

We visualized the dataset of containg PC1,PC2 and sample variable. So we can see that genes of similar group are closer to each other ;say  gene
2 and gene 4 ; we can clearly see values of S1,....S30 are closed to each other so if we study only one of them we will get properties of other.
So, we reduced our dataset like this and we study only specific genes which is one of the gene from cluster.So basically to identify bunch of 
similar gene we study single gene only and predict the properties of other genes.
