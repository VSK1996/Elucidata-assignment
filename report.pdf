Report for this assignmnt:

PC1 and PC2 are contributing more than 30% of variance of dataset. This can be seen by how eigenvalue spread from large to small;
so if we ignore the very very smallest one in svd ; their is no significant effect on data of genes. Basically we exclude redundunt data
from sample.

Remaining 22409 dimension are contributing remaining 60% of variance of dataset; although remaining contribution is 60% majority of this 
is from pc3 and pc4.

We visualized the dataset of containg PC1,PC2 and sample variable. So we can see that genes of similar group or sample or cell are closer to each other ;So if the two samples are closer to each other in pc1 and pc2 plot then we say that they have similar type of properties. so if we study only one of them we will get properties of other.
So, we reduced our dataset like this and we distinguish datset of cells or samples like this from one another.
